Selectr is so feature-packed that it needs it's own documentation site so why not head over there now - [Demos & Documentation](http://mobius.ovh/docs/selectr)

## NOTICE

Selectr started out as a plugin I wrote for personal use to replace Select2 as I no longer use jQuery on my projects. It was never meant for uses other than my projects so at the moment it's a mess of bugs, dodgy fixes and workarounds to make it usable for other people's projects. Due to an increasing number of people using the plugin I've decided to rebuild Selectr from the ground up as a proper plugin instead of a script bodged to work with other projects.

v2.0.0 of Selectr is currently scheduled for release this week along with completed documentation. Therefore, versions 1.x.x will be deprecated shortly thereafter and no longer supported.
