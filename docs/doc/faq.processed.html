    <h3 id="why-is-the-google-analytics-code-at-the-bottom-google-recommends-it-be-placed-in-the-head-">Why is the Google Analytics code at the bottom? Google recommends it be placed in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</h3>
    <p>The main advantage of placing it in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is that you will track the user&#39;s <code>pageview</code> even if they leave the page before it has been fully loaded. However, having the code at the bottom of the page <a href="https://stevesouders.com/efws/inline-scripts-bottom.php">helps improve
performance</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="how-can-i-integrate-bootstrap-http-getbootstrap-com-with-html5-boilerplate-">How can I integrate <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> with HTML5 Boilerplate?</h3>
    <p>One simple way is to use <a href="http://www.initializr.com/">Initializr</a> and create a custom build that includes both HTML5 Boilerplate and
      <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>

    <p>No, same as you don&#39;t normally replace the foundation of a house once it was built. However, there is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the latest changes, but you&#39;ll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.</p>
